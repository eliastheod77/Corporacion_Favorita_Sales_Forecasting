# Corporacion Favorita Sales Forecasting
This is a Kaggle competition, where we'll use time series forecasting to forecast store sales on data from Corporación Favorita, a large Ecuadorian based grocery retailer. The evaluation metric is the Normalized Weighted Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (NWRMSLE).

For this part of the project, we will conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the dataset provided by Corporación Favorita for their sales forecasting Kaggle competition. 
EDA is an essential step in understanding the structure, patterns, and characteristics of the data before building predictive models.

# Dataset
The dataset includes historical sales data from Corporación Favorita's supermarkets across various locations, product categories, and time periods. It consists of the following datasets:

Train Data: Contains historical sales data with features such as date, store number, product family, sales, promotions, and more.
Additional Data: Includes holiday events, oil price, store details, and transaction information to enrich the analysis.
EDA Objectives
The main objectives of the EDA phase are:

Data Exploration: Explore the structure and characteristics of the dataset to gain insights into the sales data and underlying patterns.

Identify Trends and Patterns: Identify trends, seasonal patterns, and other significant patterns in the sales data.

Detect Anomalies and Outliers: Detect any anomalies or outliers in the data that may affect the forecasting models.

Understand Relationships: Understand the relationships between different features and their impact on sales.

EDA Process
Data Loading: Load the datasets into the analysis environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).

Data Cleaning: Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Feature Exploration: Explore the distribution and characteristics of features such as sales, promotions, product families, and store details.

Time Series Analysis: Conduct time series analysis to understand trends, seasonality, and other temporal patterns in the sales data.

Correlation Analysis: Explore the correlations between different features to identify potential relationships and dependencies.

Visualization: Visualize the data using charts, graphs, and plots to facilitate understanding and interpretation.

Key Findings
Based on the EDA conducted, we will summarize key findings, insights, and observations about the sales data, including:

Trends and seasonality in sales over time.
Impact of promotions on sales.
Relationships between product families, store locations, and sales.
Any anomalies or outliers detected in the data.
Conclusion
The EDA phase provides valuable insights into the sales data, helping to inform the next steps in the project, including feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. These insights will guide the development of predictive models to forecast product sales accurately.
